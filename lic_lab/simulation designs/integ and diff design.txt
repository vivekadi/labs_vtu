RC<=T (R:feedback)
T=1/500Hz=2x10^-3

choose R=22k
R1=2.2k

this gives C=0.1uF


Gain in differentiator is more , compared to the inductor 
based on the reactance of the capacitor and its effect on the gain.

In an integrator , if we replace the capacitor with the inductor(1mH)
we get a very good pulse wave. As we decrease the inductance reactance in feedback reduces and gain drops.

Having a 1H inductor we get the integrator to work as a differentiator, and similarly a differentiator as an integrator.
